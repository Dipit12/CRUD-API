Intro to Databases:
1.Databases are a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed and managed
2. We dont work or interact with databases directly
3. Instead we use a software called DBMS(database management system)
4.Types of databases: Relational(eg: MySQL,PostgresSQL,Oracle) and NoSQL(eg: MongoDB,DynamoDB)
In a NoSQL there is no use of tables, instead there are storage solutions

SQL - structured query language - language used to communicate with DBMS
